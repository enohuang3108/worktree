## How it Works

### Adding a Worktree (`wt add`)

1. Choose to create a new branch or use an existing one
2. If new branch: enter branch name and select base branch
3. If existing: select from available branches
4. Creates worktree in `../<project-name>-worktree/<project-name>-<branch>-worktree`
5. Optionally opens in VSCode

### Removing a Worktree (`wt remove`)

1. Lists all existing worktrees
2. Select which one to remove
3. Confirms the deletion
4. Removes the worktree and cleans up

### Opening a Worktree (`wt open`)

1. Lists all existing worktrees
2. Select which one to open
3. Opens the selected worktree in VSCode
